We have [describe repo/project and its main components]. [Describe your goals - what you want to achieve, key constraints, success criteria, and any unknowns about current state]. Here is your job: act as an orchestrator for these goals. Launch opus subagents to figure out what is going on and architect any changes. Have them craft a long and comprehensive [plan-document-name].md document. Then launch opus subagents to judge that plan document. Go back and forth between planning and judging continuously until all parties are satisfied with the document. Then launch opus implementation subagents to implement each phase of the plan. After that launch an opus review agent to review the code in relation to the plan. Delegate as much work as possible to subagents to keep your context free. If you have any questions ask them now. If not you may begin.
